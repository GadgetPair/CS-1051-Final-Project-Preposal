## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The two main ideas going through my mind right now are making donkey kong with a multiplayer versus element where one person plays as mario and another actually controls donkey kong, throwing a selected barrel type at a selected time and I think I might give the donkey kong player some new abilities, such as a ground pound ability that forces mario to jump and stuns him if he’s on a ladder.

My other idea was space invaders with a difficulty selection between standard space invaders and a setting where at some point (haven’t decided if it’s immediate, based on percentage of enemies defeated, based on time, or another event) the invaders stop moving side to side and begin moving straight down.

Other ideas I have are a text based game navigating through a Zelda style dungeon, or a mario clone, but I’m struggling with ideas for how to build upon mario in a unique way
